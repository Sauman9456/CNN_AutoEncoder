# CNN_AutoEncoder

## Problem Statement:

Implement a CNN in which the input is a noisy number and the output is a denoised number. 
Use MNIST dataset. Use Gaussian distribution to add noise to the input. Plot the training & validation loss. 
Build a classifier based on the trained Auto encoder. Extract the trained encoder and fine tune only the fully connected layer to classify the digits (the input is a noisy number)


## Solution:

Step1: Goto the current working directory from command prompt

Step2: Install requirements.txt (which contain the required Python libraries) by using the following
command:

   >> python -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt

Step3: Run CNN_Autoenc.py

   >>python CNN_Autoenc.py

This will produce the desired output
